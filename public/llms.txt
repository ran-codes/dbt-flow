# dbt-planner

> Free, browser-based dbt lineage visualization and planning tool.

## What is this?

dbt-planner is a web application for visualizing dbt (data build tool) project lineage graphs. It helps data engineers and analytics engineers:

- Visualize DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) from manifest.json
- Plan new models before writing code
- Analyze upstream/downstream dependencies
- Export work plans as Markdown or JSON

## Key Features

- Load any dbt manifest.json (via URL, file upload, or paste)
- Interactive graph navigation (pan, zoom, select)
- Filter by layer (source, staging, intermediate, mart)
- Filter by resource type (model, source, seed, test)
- Filter by tags (AND/OR mode)
- Focus mode for upstream/downstream analysis
- Add proposed models visually
- Edit node metadata (description, tags, SQL)
- Export work plans (Markdown with JSON)
- Local browser storage (no backend)

## Technical Details

- Built with Next.js 15, React Flow, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
- Static export (works on GitHub Pages)
- No server-side processing - all data stays in browser
- Parses dbt manifest.json format
